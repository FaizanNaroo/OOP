# OOP
C++ OOP &amp; Project Portfolio: A collection of C++ programs demonstrating core OOP concepts, including custom classes, operator overloading, file handling, and data structures. Projects include utility apps, games, and management systems.


Features
1. OOP Apps Portfolio

A menu-driven C++ application demonstrating key OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, operator overloading, and dynamic memory management.
Options include:

Email ID Extractor – Extracts all email IDs from a given text or list of emails.

Polynomial Calculator – Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and evaluation of polynomials.

3D Vectors – Perform operations like addition, subtraction, dot and cross product on 3D vectors.

Custom String Class (MyString) – Implements string operations including concatenation, substring, case conversion, and more.

Roman Numerals – Convert, add, subtract, and manipulate Roman numerals.

Gaming Tournament Management System – Track players, scores, and match results.

Online Content Platform Evaluation – Evaluate content based on predefined metrics and generate reports.

2. xAI Bank (Banking Management System)

Simulates a basic banking system with checking and savings accounts.
Key features:

Deposits split evenly between checking and savings accounts.

Withdrawals from savings incur a $5 fee; withdrawals must not exceed balance.

Savings earn 5% interest using the applyinterest command.

View account balances and transaction history.

Command-driven interface for deposit, withdraw, interest, and account management.

3. Battle Arena (Ninja-Monster Game)

A text-based survival game where the player combats monsters and ninjas.
Game mechanics:

Player starts at (0,0) with 100 health.

Monsters deal damage if distant; ninjas deal damage if close.

Move strategically to avoid damage or attack enemies.

Win by defeating all 10 enemies; lose if health reaches 0.

Command interface for movement, attack, status check, and quitting.

Visual map display with player (P) and enemies (M/N).

4. Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Classic two-player N x N tic-tac-toe with dynamic board size (minimum 3).
Features:

Player name input and symbol assignment (X or O).

Dynamic win condition based on board size (e.g., 4 in a row for 4x4).

Real-time board updates and player turn prompts.

Text-based interface for easy gameplay in the terminal.

Highlights

Strong emphasis on OOP principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.

Use of operator overloading, dynamic memory management, and custom class implementations.

Interactive, menu-driven programs with clear user instructions.

Fun game simulations with strategic and command-driven gameplay.
